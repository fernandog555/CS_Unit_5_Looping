Exercise Instructions
--
5-1
--
Write an application named SumFiveInts that allows the user to enter five integers and displays their sum.

5-2
--
Write an application named SumInts that allows the user to enter any number of integers continuously until the user enters 999. Display the sum of the values entered, not including 999.

5-3
--
Write an application named EnterUppercaseLetters that asks the user to type an uppercase letter from the keyboard. If the character entered is an uppercase letter, display: OK; if it is not an uppercase letter, display the error message: Sorry - that was not an uppercase letter. . The program continues until the user types an exclamation point (!).

5-4
--
Write an application named DailyTemps that continuously prompts a user for a series of daily high temperatures until the user enters a sentinel value of 999. Valid temperatures range from -20 through 130 Fahrenheit. When the user enters a valid temperature, add it to a total; when the user enters an invalid temperature, display the error message: Valid temperatures range from -20 to 130. Please reenter temperature.

Danielle, Edward, and Francis are three salespeople at Holiday Homes. Write an application named HomeSales that prompts the user for a salesperson initial (D, E, or F) input as a string. Either uppercase or lowercase initials are valid. While the user does not type Z, continue by prompting for the amount of a sale. Issue the error message "Sorry - invalid salesperson" for any invalid initials entered. Keep a running total of the amounts sold by each salesperson. After the user types Z or z for an initial, display each salesperson’s total, a grand total for all sales, and the name of the salesperson with the highest total unless there is a tie. If there is a tie, indicate this in the program's output with the message: "There was a tie".

Write an application named DisplayMultiplicationTable that displays a table of the products of every combination of two integers from 1 through 10. Your output should resemble the figure below. 

5-7
--
Write an application named MultiplicationTable that prompts the user for an integer value, for example 7. Then display the product of every integer from 1 through 10 when multiplied by the entered value. For example, the first three lines of the table might read 1 x 7 = 7, 2 x 7 = 14, and 3 x 7 = 21.

5-8
--
Write an application named OddNums that displays all the odd numbers from 1 through 99.

5-9
--
Write an application named Sum200 that sums the integers from 1 through 200. Display the running total when the program is halfway complete (after the first 100 numbers), and at the end.

5-10
--
Write an application named Perfect that displays every perfect number from 1 through 10,000. A number is perfect if it equals the sum of all the smaller positive integers that divide evenly into it. For example, 6 is perfect because 1, 2, and 3 divide evenly into it and their sum is 6.

In a “You Do It” section of Chapter 5 in your book, you created a tipping table for patrons to use when analyzing their restaurant bills. Now, create a modified program named TippingTable3 in which each of the following values is obtained from user input:

    The lowest tipping percentage
    The highest tipping percentage
    The lowest possible restaurant bill
    The highest restaurant bill

Below is a summary of the "You Do It" section's instructions:

Write a program that creates a tipping table that restaurant patrons can use to approximate the correct tip for meals. Prices range from $10 to $100, and tipping percentage rates range from 10 percent to 25 percent. The program uses several loops.

Write a program named WebAddress that asks a user for a business name. Suggest a good Web address by adding www. to the front of the name, removing all spaces from the name, and adding .com to the end of the name. For example, a good Web address for Acme Plumbing and Supply is www. AcmePlumbingandSupply .com.
